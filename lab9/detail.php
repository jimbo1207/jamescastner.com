		<h2>Humble beginnings</h2>
		<p>Sugaring season starts when the spring air comes forth and the snow begins to melt. This indicated that
			the sap within the
			Sugar Maple Trees will start to loosen and run smooth. Sugaring season will typically last between 4-6
			weeks but ultimatley it depends when the buds on the tress start to flower.</p>

		<h2>Collection</h2>
		<p>Gathering the syrup is pretty easy, a hole is simply drilled into the tree and is gathered by some sort
			of bucket.
			Often many taps are strung together and routed to a central pump house when negative pressure is applied
			to the syrup lines
			drawing all the sap flowing from the tress into a central collection area.</p>

		<h2>Creation</h2>
		<p>Through reverse osmosis the water is then removed from the sap. After this the sap can be boiled until a
			temperature of
			219 deg f is reached, at which point it can continue to cook to reach the disired thickness and color is
			achieved.</p>
		<small>Fun fact... Vermont is responsible for 50% of the worlds maple syrup production</small>

		<h2>Benefits</h2>
		<p>Maple syrup is the perfect natural enery boost during a slow winter day. Originally, when the spring thaw
			came tribe members knew it was time to start trapping the trees
			Not only does it provide a great source of energy, syrup also has 24 different antioxidants, is an
			antiflamatory agent, and could protect against cancer!</p>
